# Suicidal And Non Suicidal Detection Using Ml with XAI
Overview:
In this project, I have created and used a supervised machine learning pipeline to detect suicidal intent from text data.Three approaches are evaluated which are Random Forest, Decision Tree and LGBM
The research question is how effectively can the ml based framework can detect suicide-related patterns in text?

Dataset:
This dataset was collected from Kaggle and consists of posts sourced from the SuicideWatch and Depression subreddits on the Reddit platform. The dataset contains three columns, where the second column includes the text content of each post, and the third column represents the corresponding class label.

Methodology:
Data preprocessing like cleaning , feature extraction and model evaluation have done there. At the end XAI was implemented with each model.
Evaluation Metrices:
Accuracy,Precision,Recall and F1 Score was evaluated for Random Forest, Decision Tree and LightGBM. 

Conclusion:
Among all model LightGBM performed efficiently than other two.
